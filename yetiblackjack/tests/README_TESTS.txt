Unit tests (planned)
-------------------

We will add lightweight unit tests once core rules and shoe logic are extracted.
Initial test targets:
  - Hand totals (Aces, soft/hard)
  - Blackjack detection
  - KO count updates
  - Deterministic engine flow with a fixed shoe

Tooling will be chosen later (Vitest or a simple in-browser runner).
